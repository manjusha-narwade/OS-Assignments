Problem 1

a) Navigate and List
Navigate to your home directory:
 => cd 
List its contents:
 => ls
create "Linux assignment"
 => mkdir Linuxassignment
Move into the "LinuxAssignment" directory:
 => cd Linuxassignment


b) File Management:
Create a new file named "file1.txt":
  => touch file1.txt
Display the contents of "file1.txt"
  =>cat file1.txt


c) Directory Management:
To create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory
  => mkdir docs


d) Copy and Move Files:
To copy the "file.txt" into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt,"
  =>cp file1.txt docs/file2.txt


e) Permissions and Ownership:
To change the permissions of "file2.txt" as described and then change the owner to the current user
  =>chmod 744 docs/file2.txt
  =>chown $USER docs/file2.txt
This command sets read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions for the owner and read (4) permissions for others.

f) Final Checklist:
List the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory:
 =>ls

g) File Searching:
To find all files with the ".txt" extension in the current directory and its subdirectories,
 =>find *.txt"


To display lines containing a specific word in a file,
 =>grep "specific_word" filename.txt

h) System Information:
To display the current system date and time
 =>date


i) Networking:
To display the IP address
 =>ip addr

Ping a remote server to check connectivity

j) File Compression:

To compress the "docs" directory into a zip file
 =>zip -r docs.zip docs
Now, to extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory
 =>unzip docs.zip -d extracted_docs


k) File Editing:
To open and edit "file1.txt" in a text editor
 =>vi file1.txt
 =>cat file1.txt
Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word
 =>sed -i 's/how/hello/g' file1.txt
 =>cat file1.txt


Problem 2

a)Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the 
first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command.
=>head -n 10 data.txt

b)Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of 
"data.txt" using another command
=>tail -n 5 data.txt


c)In a file named "numbers.txt," there are a series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of 
this file to analyze the initial data set.
=>head -n 15 numbers.txt


d)To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display the last 3 lines of "numbers.txt"
=>tail -n 3 numbers.txt


e)Imagine you have a file named "input.txt" with text content. Use a command to translate 
all lowercase letters to uppercase in "input.txt" and save the modified text in a new file 
named "output.txt." 
=>tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < input.txt > output.txt

f)In a file named "duplicate.txt," there are several lines of text, some of which are 
duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from "duplicate.txt." 
=>uniq duplicate.txt



g)In a file named "fruit.txt," there is a list of fruits, but some fruits are repeated. Use a 
command to display each unique fruit along with the count of its occurrences in 
"fruit.txt." 
=>sort fruit.txt | uniq -c
